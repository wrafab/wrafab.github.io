<p> Laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Originally theorized by Albert Einstein in 1917, 
Its basically just highly focused, highly amplified light. A laser has a high degree of coherence, meaning the light has limited diffraction, 
is polarized, and has a single, consistent frequency over a long distance. Laser cutting is basically just a laser on a CNC gantry. The machine 
takes a set of vectors, points, or raster images in the form of G-code and movesthe laser around to cut and / or etch into the material. Epilog 
released the first laser in 1988 for small business and in 2008 the Zing was introduced for $10,000. (Instructables)

<b>Assignment</b><br>
<div style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
<p>
1. Design a cardboard box using both raster and vector using MakerCase. The box must have both vector and raster on it.   
The box should also be small- around a few inches.
</p>  
<br>
<p>
2. Create a puzzle using both raster and vector.  Raster a picture on the cardboard and then vector cut the puzzle out using the file atttached or design 
your own puzzle pieces.  
</p>
<p>
Or  
 </p>
 <p>
 Create something using the living hinge.  It must be your own design, but you can download some of the sample files provided up above.  
 </p>
 <p>
 3. Create a rubber stamp.   The rubber stamp will be an original design and we will attach it to a wood piece.   
 </p>
 <p>
 4. Create a design for either a water bottle or glass using the rotary attachment for the laser.
