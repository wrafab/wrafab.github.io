<p> Laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Originally theorized by Albert Einstein in 1917, 
Its basically just highly focused, highly amplified light. A laser has a high degree of coherence, meaning the light has limited diffraction, 
is polarized, and has a single, consistent frequency over a long distance. Laser cutting is basically just a laser on a CNC gantry. The machine 
takes a set of vectors, points, or raster images in the form of G-code and moves the laser around to cut and / or etch into the material. Epilog 
released the first laser in 1988 for small business and in 2008 the Zing was introduced for $10,000. (Instructables)

<b>Assignment</b><br>
<div style="margin-left: 2.5%;">
<p>
Cut your jigsaw puzzle using vector.  Include the files on your blog and pictures of your puzzle.   
</p>
 <br>
 <p> Design a cardboard box using both raster and vector using MakerCase. 
  The box must have both vector and raster on it. The box should also be small- around a few inches.  
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>
  You need to complete three different shapes using CorelDraw or Fusion to make a press fit kit.  Using cardboard, cut out several of each 
  shape and make sure they fit together snuggly.   Take pictures, include the original files and describe the process of how you made it fit
  together.  
<p>
<b>You must make 2 of the following assignments on the laser.
</b></p>
<p>
1. Create a design and raster it on the cork coaster.   
</p>
 <p>
 2. Create something using the living hinge.  It must be your own design, but you can download some of the sample files provided up above.  
 </p>
 <p>
 3. Create a leather band.  You can create either a wrist band or a bookmark using the leather or metal.   
 </p>
 <p>
 4. Create a design for either a water bottle or glass using the rotary attachment for the laser.
